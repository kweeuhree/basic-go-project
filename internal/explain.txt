The internal directory

The internal directory will contain the ancillary non-application-
specific code used in the project. We’ll use it to hold potentially
reusable code like validation helpers and the SQL database
models for the project.

It’s important to point out that the directory name internal carries a
special meaning and behavior in Go: any packages which live under
this directory can only be imported by code inside the parent of the
internal directory. In our case, this means that any packages which
live in internal can only be imported by code inside our snippetbox
project directory.
Or, looking at it the other way, this means that any packages under
internal cannot be imported by code outside of our project.

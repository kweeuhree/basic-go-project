Template actions and functions
To to invoke one template from another {{template}} action can be used. 
But Go also provides a {{block}}...{{end}} action which you can use instead. 
This acts like the {{template}} action, except it allows you to specify some 
default content if the template being invoked doesn’t exist in the current 
template set.
In the context of a web application, this is useful when you want to
provide some default content (such as a sidebar) which individual
pages can override on a case-by-case basis if they need to.

Control the display of dynamic data — {{if}}, {{with}} and {{range}}:
    {{if .Foo}} C1 {{else}} C2 {{end}} 
If .Foo is not empty then render the content C1, otherwise render the content C2.

    {{with .Foo}} C1 {{else}} C2 {{end}}
If .Foo is not empty, then set dot to the value of .Foo and render the
content C1, otherwise render the content C2.

    {{range .Foo}} C1 {{else}} C2 {{end}}
If the length of .Foo is greater than zero then loop over each element,
setting dot to the value of each element and rendering the content C1.
If the length of .Foo is zero then render the content C2. The underlying
type of .Foo must be an array, slice, map, or channel.


Nested templates
It’s really important to note that when you’re invoking one template
from another template, dot needs to be explicitly passed or pipelined
to the template being invoked. You do this by including it at the end
of each {{template}} or {{block}} action, like so:
{{template "main" .}}
{{block "sidebar" .}}{{end}}
As a general rule, my advice is to get into the habit of always
pipelining dot whenever you invoke a template with the
{{template}} or {{block}} actions, unless you have a good reason
not to.

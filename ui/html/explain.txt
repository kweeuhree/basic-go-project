To to invoke one template from another {{template}} action can be used. 
But Go also provides a {{block}}...{{end}} action which you can use instead. 
This acts like the {{template}} action, except it allows you to specify some 
default content if the template being invoked doesnâ€™t exist in the current 
template set.
In the context of a web application, this is useful when you want to
provide some default content (such as a sidebar) which individual
pages can override on a case-by-case basis if they need to.

<!-- Within your HTML templates, any dynamic data that you pass in is
represented by the . character (referred to as dot).
In this specific case, the underlying type of dot will be a
models.Snippet struct. When the underlying type of dot is a struct,
you can render (or yield) the value of any exported field in your
templates by postfixing dot with the field name. So, because our
models.Snippet struct has a Title field, we could yield the snippet
title by writing {{.Title}} in our templates. -->
